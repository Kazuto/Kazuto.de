Over the past five years, I've worked on a bunch of projects and
gotten my hands dirty with an impressive array of technologies. Go,
Vue, Nuxt Node.js â€” you name it, I've probably dabbled in it. And
let's not forget about databases like MySQL and MongoDB. I've got
the tools and the know-how to make things happen.

But it's not just about the technical stuff. I've got an eye for aesthetics and a deep
appreciation for user experience. I love collaborating with teams,
bringing design and development together to create seamless,
eye-catching websites that leave users in awe.
